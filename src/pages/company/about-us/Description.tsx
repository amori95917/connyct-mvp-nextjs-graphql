						We believe that we are on the face of the earth to make great products and that s not
						changing. We are constantly focusing on innovating. We believe in the simple not the complex.
						We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that
						we make, and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution. We
						believe in saying no to thousands of projects, so that we can really focus on the few that are
						truly important and meaningful to us. We believe in deep collaboration and cross-pollination
						of our groups, which allow us to innovate in a way that others cannot. And frankly, we don t
						settle for anything less than excellence in every group in the company, and we have the
						self-honesty to admit when we re wrong and the courage to change. And I think regardless of
						who is in what job those values are so embedded in this company that Apple will do extremely
						well
